# Tido

A task / project management tool to rule them all

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. 
It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `frontend`: a React.js app using Mantine UI, react-query and a few other goodies.
- `api`: an Express.js REST API using Prisma / MySQL

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
